# Decision Log: GoBuddy

This document tracks significant architectural and design decisions made during the development of the GoBuddy application.

## Architectural Decisions

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - Creation of Memory Bank

**Decision**: Implement a Memory Bank to maintain project context and track development progress.

**Rationale**: A Memory Bank provides a structured way to document the project's architecture, decisions, and progress, making it easier to maintain context across development sessions.

**Implications**:

- Improved documentation of the project
- Better tracking of architectural decisions
- Enhanced context for future development

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - Identified Current Architecture

**Decision**: Documented the current architecture based on code analysis.

**Rationale**: Understanding the existing architecture is crucial for making informed decisions about future development.

**Implications**:

- Clearer understanding of the system's structure
- Better ability to plan future enhancements
- Identification of potential areas for improvement

## Technology Choices

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - React with TypeScript

**Decision**: The application uses React with TypeScript.

**Rationale**: React provides a component-based architecture that is well-suited for building interactive UIs, while TypeScript adds static typing to improve code quality and developer experience.

**Implications**:

- Improved code quality through static typing
- Better developer experience with IDE support
- Potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TypeScript

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - Zustand for State Management

**Decision**: The application uses Zustand for state management.

**Rationale**: Zustand provides a simple and lightweight state management solution that is well-suited for the application's needs, particularly for managing the multi-step onboarding flow.

**Implications**:

- Simplified state management compared to more complex solutions like Redux
- Easy integration with React components
- Centralized state for the onboarding process

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - Supabase for Backend/Authentication

**Decision**: The application uses Supabase for backend services and authentication.

**Rationale**: Supabase provides a comprehensive backend-as-a-service solution with built-in authentication, database, and storage capabilities.

**Implications**:

- Reduced need for custom backend development
- Simplified authentication flow
- Integration with Postgres database

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - TanStack Router for Routing

**Decision**: The application uses TanStack Router for routing.

**Rationale**: TanStack Router provides a type-safe routing solution that integrates well with React and TypeScript.

**Implications**:

- Type-safe routing with TypeScript integration
- Improved developer experience
- Potential learning curve for developers unfamiliar with TanStack Router

### [2025-05-03 16:10:00] - Leaflet for Maps

**Decision**: The application uses Leaflet for maps.

**Rationale**: Leaflet is a lightweight and flexible open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

**Implications**:

- Open-source solution without API usage limits
- Customizable map experience
- Integration with OpenStreetMap for geocoding
